340. You have fought against us as one would attack a cliff with a broken straw.
341. Aha, I see the Fuck-Up Fairy has visited us again! 
342. Proteus is no Proteus compared with you.
343. Your mamma so fat she has to wear 2 watches because she covers two time zones.
344. We meet again, Mr. Bleached Asshole.
345. If all the idiots in all the villages left their villages and formed their own village of idiots in that village you would  be the village idiot.
346. I caught you wanking off to the Australian gecko like SAVE ME THAT 15% ON MY CAR INSURANCE A LITTLE HARDER DADDY
347. You truly have the body of a boy who died in the Irish potato famine and a face of a woman who survived it.
348. Would thou wouldst burst!
349. When you were born, the police arrested your dad, the doctor slapped your mom, animal control euthanized your brother, and A&amp;E made a documentary that saved your life.
350. I have neither the time nor the crayons to explain it to you.
351. You sleep with so many boys, you�re starting to look like one.
352. There you are, like butter in sunshine.
353. Your family tree is a cactus, because everybody on it is a prick.
354. You people are more stupid than a block of wood.
355. Every letter of yours breathes Moabitish pride. So much can a single bull inflate a single bubble that you practically make distinguished asses into gods.
356. Acting like a dick won't make yours any more bigger either.
357. Were you born a cunt, or is it something you have to recommit yourself to every morning?
358. Some people are just dumb. Take you for example!
359. In our country, fruit grows on trees and from trees, and meditation upon sin grows from contrition. But in your land, trees may grow on fruits, contrition from sins, people walk on their ears, and everything is upside down.
360. My soul, like Ezekiel's, is nauseated at eating your bread covered with human dung. Do you know what this means?
